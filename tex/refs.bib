	abstract = {In weak lensing investigations, galaxy shapes are deconvolved for the effects of the point spread function (PSF) using stellar images. In this paper we use physical models of the telescope optics to understand the spatial variation of the PSF in the image plane. We introduce a set of parameters to model the key aberrations, which include defocus, focal plane tilt, primary and off-axis astigmatism. We also include the effects of guiding and seeing. We test our model with data from the Blanco 4 meter telescope in Cerro Tololo, Chile. We find that the physical model describes a substantial part of the PSF size and anisotropy over the field of view (over 90 percent of it, based on a chi-squared metric). We identify the primary contributors to the PSF patterns and study their covariances and principal components. We also identify correlations with the effect of gravity on the telescope. Finally, we discuss the improvements in PSF estimation that may be achieved by combining the physical model in this study with the purely empirical approach of Jarvis and Jain (2004).},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0412234},
	abstract = {We introduce a new algorithm for interpolating measurements of the point-spread function (PSF) using stars from many exposures. The principal components of the variation in the PSF pattern from multiple exposures are used to solve for better fits for each individual exposure. These improved fits are then used to correct the weak lensing shapes. Since we expect some degree of correlation in the PSF anisotropy across exposures, using information from stars in all exposures leads to a significant gain in the accuracy of the estimated PSF. It means that in general, the accuracy of PSF reconstruction is limited not by the number density of stars per exposure, but by the stacked number density across all exposures in a given survey. This technique is applied to the 75 square degree CTIO lensing survey, and we find that the PSF variation is well described by a small number of components. There is a significant improvement in the lensing measurements: the residual stellar PSF correlations are reduced by several orders of magnitude, and the measured B-mode in the two-point correlation is consistent with zero down to 1 arcminute. We also discuss the applications of the PCA technique to future surveys.},

	abstract = {The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will use an active optics system (AOS) to maintain alignment and surface figure on its three large mirrors. Corrective actions fed to the LSST AOS are determined from information derived from 4 curvature wavefront sensors located at the corners of the focal plane. Each wavefront sensor is a split detector such that the halves are 1mm on either side of focus. In this paper we describe the extensions to published curvature wavefront sensing algorithms needed to address challenges presented by the LSST, namely the large central obscuration, the fast f/1.23 beam, off-axis pupil distortions, and vignetting at the sensor locations. We also describe corrections needed for the split sensors and the effects from the angular separation of different stars providing the intra- and extra-focal images. Lastly, we present simulations that demonstrate convergence, linearity, and negligible noise when compared to atmospheric effects when the algorithm extensions are applied to the LSST optical system. The algorithm extensions reported here are generic and can easily be adapted to other wide-field optical systems including similar telescopes with large central obscuration and off-axis curvature sensing.},
